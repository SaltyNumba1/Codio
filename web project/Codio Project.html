          <h1>Welcome to my page!</h1><br>
            <p> This page is curently a work in progress. As I learn new ways to edit this page and add styles through css, sass, & js I hope to showcase my talents to prospective employers. I also plan to use this in the future as building <br> blocks for 
  my 3d printing business. On this website i would like to host services related to beginner tutorials & basic need to knows, Printing services, CAD service and lastly repair service in the extended future. <br>
  My galley will host images of products I  have printed from my own machines, including timelapse footage. I would also like a section to host CAD requested models to showcase that service. 
  In my Blog you will find examples <br> of styling and how I struggled to attain those styles. Just as the Repair service is slated for the extended future so is the order's tab, as of now-I have no orders to fulfill! </p>

        <h1>About me!</h1>

<p> My name is Caleb Beam and I currently reside in Washington state. We originally hail from Arizona, Tucson to be specific. When I lived in Arizona I worked as a structural repairmen for Bombardier&copy;. Having graduated A&P school in the fall of 2016, I worked there for 3.5 years before making the move to Washington. <br>
I moved to Washington in the winter of 19'. Right before the world shut down. I accepted a postion as an Assembly Technician for Prime air and have been with this org ever since. I recently was promoted to L4 and that gave me the confidence to try this class out. However, that reason is miniscule in comparison to the newest addition to our family.</p>
<br>
      
<p>My son, Ezra, was born March 6 at 5:08AM. He has been such an amazing addition to both my wife and I's lives. We both have grown in ways 
</p>

  <p> 
that have made our marriage stronger and more resilliant to change. I was lucky enough to receive paternity leave for 2.5 months to bond with my son and wife while she healed. To which <strong>WOMEN ARE STRONG AS HELL.</strong>
Through that experience I ultimately decided I needed a WFH career that would allow me be around my son as often as possible to nuture him in the ways that make him a functioning individual on whatever path he chooses. As a new Father, I feel of responsibilty to not necessarily raise a son that is cutout for corporate america - hell that's not what I want, but that's what was nutured upon me and here we are - but an individual who
is happy with himself, Makes choices that not only benefit him but those around him in positive ways, I want him to take care of the earth better than we have, to be a man that is respectful to woman and knows/applies the word consent. With all of that said - I need to be around my son more than I need to be at a corporate office. 
This also means there may come a time I have to work for myself if I wish to be WFH full-time. Enter my 3d printing obsession! 
3d printing became a hobby of mine thanks to a dear friend of mine that I coincidently met at Amazon. One day I saw three beautiful prusa mk3's buzzzing along making parts to help us with our jobs. I sat down and conversated with my friend about the means you have to go about putting a design into a software that can interpret all of those finite moves a printer has to perform.
At the time, i didn't understand why but.. He laughed. I felt like a bother to be frank and I almost walked away. Looking back on it now-I completely understand what it is to have the knowledge of 3d-printing and the extent at which one can go into those depths of finite tuning,modding,layer testing,fan swapping and on and on.. and then to be asked how it works. The flood of information that your mind wants to regurgate on to this poor soul is 
and can be astounding, informational, and very techy, but at the same time laughable about how easy it is to do.
